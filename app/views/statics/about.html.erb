    <h1>Every Theripist is a Business unto Themselves</h1>
    <p>It is our belief that every massage therapist is a business! Whether they work for a spa, do outcalls, or keep their own office, they all produce massage, and sell it. To reach a point of personal and professional fullfilment
       every therapist needs to connect with people who need massage. We are all healers, but to heal we need to eat, have security for our families, and afford to pay for more education. It is our sincerest hope that Massage Website
       Guru will help you reach your greatest level of success.</p>

    <h1>Who is Adam?</h1>
    <%= image_tag "avatar.gif" %>
    <p>Throughout this site and accross the web you will see lots of tips and videos from Adam. But who is this elusive public figure? And more importantly, why isn't he wearing a cape?</p>
    <p>All joking aside, Adam Fluke is Simplissage's Massage Therapist in residence, and founder. He is a LMT* in Louissianna, and has a practice in New Orleans that he has built-up from zilch.
It is from his expierence that Simplissage was born. </p><blockquote>"I did online massage marketing the hard way, luckily, now you don't have to."</blockquote> <p>At one time Adam was registered for six different online services, paying hundreds of dollars a month because each service charged their little bit.
Frustrated with the time and money it took to create and maintain his online presense he started asking the big questions, "Why is there no service that does everything I know I need to be successful?",
"What would that service look like if it did exist?", "What would help me compete against the <i>big guys</i> in my market?".</p>
    <p>After months of these questions rhueminating in his brain, Adam decided that this service had to be made! It needed to exist because being an independent massage practitioner was hard enough without
the constant hassel of logging into six different sites, and manually doing everyting. One of his most common complaints was that no matter how much he worked it, he ended up doing simple tasks everymonth,
like updating and reviewing his newsletter list based on the contacts he made through the blog, scheduler, and website. And everymonth, the universe would here his cry, "I am a healer, not a typist!"</p>
